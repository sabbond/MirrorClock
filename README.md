Take a time from a mirror image of an analogue clock and convert to the actual time

two implementations:
mirrorTime: works with hours and minutes separately
mirrorTime2: reflects the total minutes elapsed and then transforms to a time string

unit tests around both, with validation tests on mirrorTime2

Both methods only accept times in format HH:MM, return success in same format or error message
